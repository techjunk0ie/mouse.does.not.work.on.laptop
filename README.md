Make sure the wireless mouse is receiving power by checking for some indication of power (usually a light). Move your mouse around on the mousepad to see if any indicator comes on. If your mouse has a power switch, it's often on the bottom side. If the mouse doesn't appear to be on, replace the batteries.

## How To Get the Mouse To Work on Laptop?

Sometimes a simple change can make a laptop mouse start working again. Other times, you’ll need a complete replacement. Even if you aren’t up to tackling the replacement yourself, the rest of the troubleshooting should be a breeze, even for a novice. 

Keep in mind you may have to hook up an external mouse to help you troubleshoot your laptop mouse. 

## What Stops a USB Mouse from Working?

**_There are a lot of components that can stop a USB mouse from working. Here are a few reasons your laptop does not detect a USB mouse._**

* Physical damages
* Faulty USB mouse
* USB power settings
* USB and mouse driver disabled
* Low battery on mouse
* Outdated Windows/driver
 
## How to Fix a PC or Laptop Mouse That's Not Working?

* Inspect the mouse for hardware damage. A cracked housing, a missing ball, sticky or silent clicking of the finger switches, or a failure of the optical sensor to glow suggest that the device is damaged. Given how inexpensive most mice are, hardware damage usually suggests that replacement, rather than repair, is the optimal solution.

* Clean the mouse. If the pointer moves in jerking motions or is less responsive than usual, clean the mouse to see if it improves the performance. It's easy to clean a wireless mouse or clean a wired mouse with a rollerball.

* Replace the batteries. Swap the batteries out for a new set, especially if you're still using the batteries that came with the device. Likewise, verify the batteries are properly installed.

Similarly, plug the mouse into its charger for 30 minutes to let it get enough juice to connect. Mice with USB charger ports and non-rechargeable batteries sometimes appear to fail without warning when charge levels decline too much.

* Try a different USB port. There might be a problem with the one you're using, so unplug the mouse or the receiver and try an alternate USB port. Most desktop computers offer ports on the front and back of the computer, so try all of the ports before jumping to a different step. It could also be the case that the plug is partially unseated.

* Connect the mouse directly to the USB port. If you use a multi-card reader or an external USB hub, there may be a problem with that device instead of the mouse or USB port. Plug the mouse directly into the computer to see if the problem clears.

* Use the mouse on an appropriate surface. Some mice can be used on (almost) any kind of surface. Many can't. Study your device's limitations—it may require a mouse pad, especially if you're using an older mouse. Some optical mice, for example, cannot track movement on shiny surfaces or surfaces with either very dark or very light colors.

* Update the driver. Check the manufacturer's website for available driver updates or use driver-updater tools. If your mouse won't do something that the manufacturer promised it would do (side-to-side scrolling, for example), find and download any required drivers from the manufacturer's website. These files are usually free.

* Release and re-pair a Bluetooth mouse. It's not uncommon for Bluetooth devices to either lose pairing status or be forgotten if a different Bluetooth mouse is paired with the PC.

* Disable an integrated trackpad. If your laptop supports an internal trackpad, disable it through your operating system's settings utility. An internal trackpad may conflict with, or override, an external mouse
